### Project Details:
A rider can request for rideshare using the application. In the app, the rider selects the drop-off location using the place picker or 'where to go?' search box. Then reviewing the price and drop-off time rider confirms the pickup.

Drivers can see and choose to accept the riderâ€™s ride request. A rider gets an automatic cellular call when a driver accepts his/her ride request.

### Current Issues
    1. 'Where to go?' search bar had stopped working.
    2. Showing suggested path from pick-up to the drop-off location had stopped working.
    3. Calculation of the distance from pick-up to drop-off never worked.
    
### Contribution 
Contribution to the project will be warmly welcomed.
